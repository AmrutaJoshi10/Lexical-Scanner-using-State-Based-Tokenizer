# Lexical-Scanner-using-State-Based-Tokenizer

This project is built using C# on visual studio 2015 platform.
The project mainly focuses on building the software tool for code analysis.
Code analysis consists of extracting lexical content from source code files, analyzing the code's syntax from its lexical content, 
and building an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) that holds the results of our analysis.
